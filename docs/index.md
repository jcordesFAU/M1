1. Executive summary

From Room 205 of Florida Atlantic University’s (FAU) Engineering East building, Perry Weinthal sells or leases various electronic parts and equipment, as well as manufactured pieces (such as those from a 3D printer) by request. To facilitate inventory-tracking, we are producing the Florida Atlantic University Original Web eLectronics Store (FAUOWLS), where students will be able to search for and purchase items they seek, and Perry and his team will be able to keep track of all equipment and parts as they come in and go out. Many web stores, such as Newark element14 (http://www.newark.com) already exist that sell electronic equipment, and Perry often purchases equipment and parts from such sites, in addition to purchasing from more general-purpose web stores like eBay (https://www.ebay.com).

The uniqueness of the FAUOWLS is that it would primarily target students at FAU either currently taking or who have taken courses in computer science, computer engineering, or electrical engineering, who would be able to purchase at no cost many electronic parts that would otherwise cost some non-zero amount, as well as lease or rent more complex equipment for free - equipment that would otherwise be prohibitively expensive for the average university student. FAUOWLS will also allow those on Perry’s team to locate equipment in various laboratories upon request, saving them the trouble of either having to memorize the location of every part or spend excessive time rummaging through drawers to find what a student seeks. Faculty, additionally, will be able to purchase, rent, or lease equipment or parts, at little to no cost, while FAUOWLS will allow Perry’s team to track all such prices in one central database.

Ultimately, FAUOWLS would allow Perry and his team to be more productive, and allow students and faculty needing parts and equipment to have a clear, easily accessible system for finding and obtaining what they’re looking for to excel in their courses - or even engineer their own experiments.
